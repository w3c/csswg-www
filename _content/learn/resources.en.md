# Resources

If you want to learn how to use CSS, then this section will point you to some helpful resources.

## Getting started

For the complete beginner we would recommend looking at the [Learn CSS material on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS). This will teach you all of the basics of the language, and help you to explore the rest of MDN, where all of the web platform is documented.

If you prefer books then a well recommended book for beginning web developers is [Learning Web Design]( http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051626.do), by Jen Robbins.

## Sites

The following sites publish frequent and up to date information on CSS and other web technologies.

- [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - all of CSS is documented here with pages about individual CSS properties and usage guides to features. If you were wishing the specifications were more like a tutorial, this is the place to go.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - useful for tips, tutorials and solutions for the problems encountered when using CSS
- [Smashing Magazine: CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/css) - regular articles on using CSS in production.
